step 1 : create a new folder for playwright project  and open in vs code 

step 2 : create a python virtual env for this project using below command 
	 
	 python -m venv my_env 

step 3 : to activate the env use below

	my_env\scripts\activate

step 4 : once env active then inside run below command 

	pip install playwright (this is useful for python to talk to browser)

(optional) to upgrade playwright use this command -->pip install playwright -u

step 5 : now we need to install actual browsers(Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit)
	 that can be used by python to run test runner for that run below command 
	 
         playwright install

step 6 : verify installation by running below command 

	python -m playwright --version or playwright --version 	  

step 7 : run below command to install pytest plugin for playwright and testing framework in python

	 pip install pytest-playwright ...(if you directly run this command you can skip 4)

         .....(you can use this command pip list to list down all packages downloaded and 
	      also if you use this command pip show pytest it will give you detailed description of it)

step 8 : now the setup is ready , now create a folder inside your playwright project give name tests

step 9 : create a python file name test_google.py ,inside this file write code on how to 

	 open google and write anything on search bar and click search (code already created using chat gpt please refer test_google.py inside Plywright_learning folder)

step 10: after the code is successfully created and run 

	 run this command pytest --help   (it will help you  give tags that can be run along, when running the code from terminal ..for eg: pytest tests\test_google.py --browser=chromium)

step 11: create folders inside root folder (playwright learning) utils, pages, reports and tests..(ignore tests if already created in step 8)

step 12: create conftest.py file under root folder (playwright learning)

         (about conftest.py imagine you are testing 10 different websites 

         without conftest.py you would need to write this same code in every test file 

         this repeating code is not good practice

         with conftest.py we define that once as a fixture and just use it in tests)

step 13: then watch this video to understand pom

--------------------understanding confitest-------------------------

when pytest fixture (scope)
🟢 Case 1 — scope="function" (default)

This is the flow you described.

Test 1 → setup → run → teardown
Test 2 → setup → run → teardown
Test 3 → setup → run → teardown


Fixture runs for every test.

🔵 Case 2 — scope="session" (Your Case)

Your login fixture runs only once.

Actual flow:

pytest starts
   ↓
session setup runs once (login)
   ↓
Test 1 → run test
Test 2 → run test
Test 3 → run test
   ↓
session teardown runs once (logout)


#how fixtures run 

1. Find all tests
2. For each test → check what fixtures it needs
3. If test needs a fixture → prepare fixture (based on scope)
4. scope sesssion is run once 
5. Run test

---------------------------------------------------------------

to understand the flow of pytest with fixture scope function and session 


⭐ How Pytest Actually Runs Them

Assume test order is:

test A
test B
test C
test D


Pytest runs in this order:

✅ Step 1 — Start pytest
Load fixtures
Load hooks
Find tests

✅ Step 2 — Run test A
Does test A need session fixture?
YES → run session fixture (first time)
→ execute test A


Session fixture is now created and kept alive.

✅ Step 3 — Run test B
Does test B need session fixture?
YES → reuse existing session fixture
→ execute test B


No new fixture run.

✅ Step 4 — Run test C
Does test C need session fixture?
YES → reuse same session fixture
→ execute test C


Still same fixture.

✅ Step 5 — Run test D
Does test D need function fixture?
YES → run function fixture
→ execute test D
→ teardown function fixture immediately


Function scope = per test.

✅ Step 6 — After All Tests
Session fixture teardown runs once


Example:

logout
close browser

🎯 Real Flow (Visual Timeline)
pytest starts
↓
session fixture runs once
↓
test A
↓
test B
↓
test C
↓
function fixture runs
↓
test D
↓
function fixture cleanup
↓
session fixture cleanup

so,

pytest runs tests one by one.
For each test it checks required fixtures.
Session fixture runs once and is reused.
Function fixture runs per test.
Session teardown runs at end.

FAQ

pip install playwright
→ Helps Python talk to and control the browser (open pages, click, type, etc.)

pip install pytest-playwright
→ Provides pytest as the test runner and connects pytest tests to Playwright,
so the steps written in pytest tests are executed in the browser by Playwright

playwright install
→ Installs actual browser binaries like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
